Description: This package contains functions to estimate plasmid cost,
    segregation rate and horizontal transfer rates from stability assays data. The
    stability asays follow periodically (usually every 24 hours) the changes in the
    fraction of plasmid free cells in serial passage cultures. At the end of each
    cycle, the experimenter takes a sample of the liquid culture and plates it after
    dilution. Using an antibiotic marker present in the plasmid, the experimenter
    can count, out of a total number of colonies plated, how many of these are
    plasmid-carrying. Here, we provide an array of statistical and mathematical
    functions to estimate the parameters of a series of dynamic models consisting
    of a pair of difference equations that follow the abundance of plasmid-free and
    plasmid-carrying cells under various biological hypotheses. The package also
    includes functions to simulate data under each model. Estimation is done via
    Maximum Likelihood. Hierarchical stochastic models are also considered. Further
    information can be found in the author papers made in collaboration with Eva
